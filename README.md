# 100 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge! This repository is a log of my daily progress, where I commit to coding for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. 
## About the Challenge

The 100 Days of Code challenge is a commitment to code for at least an hour every day for 100 days. It's a great way to build coding habits, learn new technologies, and work on personal projects.
